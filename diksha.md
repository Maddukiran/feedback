## Suggestions/Areas of Improvement

- [ ] Practice Git Commands and push the code frequently (100s of developers will be working in a single git repository, Git is a mandatory skill)
- [ ] Test the features in a separate environment like cloud servers before informing tester to test it.
- [ ] Avoid adding fields in forms which is not relevant to project.
- [ ] Maintain consistency
- [ ] Improve JavaScript skills to write testable code. 
- [ ] Remove the links in project (e.g About Us, Contact Us ) which are not working.
- [ ] Improve time management skills to meet the Scrum deadlines  ( Balance the time between frontend and backend skills )
- [ ] Node JS - Yet to start developing REST API
